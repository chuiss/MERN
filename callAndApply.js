//Call and Apply are the extended functions present in the function definition,which allows to change or update the scope of the
// given function by passing the object as a parameter

//Call - function.call is used to accept first parameter as an object which we want to apply as scope in the function, 
// and second and subsqeuent parameters will be used to pass function parameters

//Apply - function.apply is used to accpet first parameter as an object which we want to apply as scope in the function,
